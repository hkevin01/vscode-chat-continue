# Process Termination Feature Implementation

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Added automatic termination of existing vscode-chat-continue processes before starting new instances.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Process Detection**
- Scans for existing vscode-chat-continue processes using both psutil and fallback ps command
- Identifies processes by command line patterns and project-specific keywords
- Skips the current process to avoid self-termination

### 2. **Graceful Termination**
- Uses SIGTERM for graceful shutdown first
- Falls back to SIGKILL if graceful termination fails
- Waits for processes to fully terminate before proceeding

### 3. **Enhanced Command Line Interface**
- Added `--no-terminate` flag to skip automatic termination if needed
- Verbose output shows exactly which processes were terminated
- Works with all existing modes (test-freeze, gui, debug, etc.)

### 4. **Smart Process Filtering**
- Only terminates vscode-chat-continue related processes
- Additional verification ensures we're targeting the right project
- Safe handling of permission errors and non-existent processes

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Default Behavior (with termination):
```bash
python src/main.py --test-freeze
# Output: 🔍 Searching for existing processes...
#         🛑 Terminated 5 existing vscode-chat-continue process(es)
#         🔍 Starting 10-Second Freeze Detection Test Mode
```

### Skip Termination:
```bash
python src/main.py --test-freeze --no-terminate
# Starts without checking for existing processes
```

### With Debug Output:
```bash
python src/main.py --debug --test-freeze
# Shows detailed process information during termination
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Process Detection Patterns:
- `vscode-chat-continue`
- `src/main.py`
- `main.py`
- `automation_engine.py`
- `continuous_automation.py`
- `lightweight_automation.py`
- `safe_automation.py`
- `main_window.py`

### Termination Process:
1. **Scan**: Use psutil (preferred) or ps command fallback
2. **Filter**: Match against automation patterns + project verification
3. **Terminate**: SIGTERM → wait 3s → SIGKILL if needed
4. **Report**: Show number of processes terminated

### Error Handling:
- Graceful handling of permission denied errors
- Safe handling of already-terminated processes
- Fallback methods when psutil is unavailable
- Non-blocking termination failures

## 📊 Test Results

**Successful Test Run:**
```
🔍 Searching for existing vscode-chat-continue processes...
🛑 Terminated 5 existing vscode-chat-continue process(es)
✅ Cleaned up 5 existing process(es)
🔍 Starting 10-Second Freeze Detection Test Mode
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents resource conflicts
- ✅ Ensures clean startup
- ✅ Avoids duplicate automation instances
- ✅ Maintains system stability
- ✅ User-controllable via --no-terminate flag

## 🎉 Result

Your vscode-chat-continue tool now automatically cleans up any running instances before starting, ensuring:
- No resource conflicts
- Clean process management  
- Stable operation
- Configurable behavior

**The termination feature is now fully integrated and working!** 🚀
