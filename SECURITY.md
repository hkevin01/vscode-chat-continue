# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of VS Code Chat Continue Automation seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT Create Public Issues

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** This could expose the vulnerability to potential attackers.

### ‚úÖ Responsible Disclosure Process

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@example.com`
2. **GitHub Security**: Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/username/vscode-chat-continue/security/advisories)
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
4. **Environment**: OS, Python version, and application version
5. **Proof of Concept**: If available (but avoid destructive examples)
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Varies by complexity and severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

## üéØ Scope

### In Scope
- **Core Application**: Main automation engine and GUI
- **Dependencies**: Security issues in direct dependencies
- **Configuration**: Insecure default configurations
- **Data Handling**: Personal data exposure or misuse
- **Network Security**: Insecure network communications
- **Access Control**: Privilege escalation or bypass issues

### Out of Scope
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks requiring user deception
- **Physical Access**: Attacks requiring physical machine access
- **DoS Attacks**: Denial of service against the application
- **Third-party Services**: VS Code, GitHub Copilot vulnerabilities
- **User Misconfiguration**: Security issues from user misuse

## üîí Security Measures

### Current Security Features

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Safe Defaults**: Secure configurations by default
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary system permissions
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages (no sensitive data leakage)
5. **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for dependencies

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Code Signing**: Signed releases for integrity verification
- [ ] **Sandboxing**: Restricted execution environment
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- [ ] **Encryption**: Sensitive configuration data encryption
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Additional security controls

## üìä Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚úÖ Active        |
| 0.9.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited         | üîÑ Critical Only |
| < 0.9   | ‚ùå No              | ‚ùå End of Life   |

### Support Policy

- **Current Major Version**: Full security support
- **Previous Major Version**: Critical security fixes only (6 months)
- **Older Versions**: No security support

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Automation Risks

**Screen Capture and Automation Tools Inherently Pose Security Risks:**

1. **Screen Content Access**: The application captures screen content
2. **Mouse/Keyboard Control**: Simulates user input
3. **Process Monitoring**: Monitors running applications
4. **File System Access**: Reads configuration and log files

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Minimal Scope**: Only captures necessary screen regions
2. **User Consent**: Clear disclosure of required permissions
3. **Activity Detection**: Pauses during user activity
4. **Emergency Stop**: Immediate termination capability
5. **Audit Trail**: Logs all automation actions

### User Responsibilities

**Users Should:**
- Run only on trusted development machines
- Review and understand required permissions
- Keep the application updated
- Use secure configuration practices
- Monitor application behavior

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

```yaml
Security Tools:
