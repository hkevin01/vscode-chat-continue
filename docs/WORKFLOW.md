# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow, branching strategies, CI/CD pipelines, and code review processes for the VS Code Chat Continue Automation project.

## üåø Branching Strategy

We follow a **GitFlow** branching model with some modifications for better CI/CD integration.

### Main Branches

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features, staging environment
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation branches
- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical production fixes

### Feature Branches

- **`feature/*`** - New features and enhancements
- **`bugfix/*`** - Bug fixes for development
- **`refactor/*`** - Code refactoring without functionality changes
- **`docs/*`** - Documentation updates

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
# Features
feature/button-detection-enhancement
feature/multi-platform-support

# Bug fixes
bugfix/ocr-timeout-issue
bugfix/gui-freezing-linux

# Releases
release/v1.2.0
release/v2.0.0-beta

# Hotfixes
hotfix/critical-memory-leak
hotfix/security-patch-cve-2024-001
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature

# Make changes with commits
git add .
git commit -m \"feat: add amazing new feature\"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/amazing-new-feature
# Create PR to develop branch
```

### 2. Code Review Process

**Required for all PRs:**

- [ ] **Automated Checks Pass**: All CI/CD checks must be green
- [ ] **Code Review**: At least one approval from CODEOWNERS
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updated docs for new features
- [ ] **Security**: No security vulnerabilities identified

**Review Checklist:**

- Code follows project style guidelines (Black, Pylint)
- Type hints are present and accurate
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Tests cover new functionality
- Performance implications considered
- Breaking changes are documented

### 3. Release Process

```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Update version numbers
# Update CHANGELOG.md
# Final testing and bug fixes

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag v1.2.0

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.2.0

# Deploy to production
```

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### **Build and Test** (`build.yml`)

Triggers: Push to any branch, PR to `main`/`develop`

```yaml
Jobs:
- lint: Code quality checks (black, pylint, mypy)
- test: Unit and integration tests across Python 3.8-3.12
- security: Security vulnerability scanning
- build: Package building and validation
```

#### **Release** (`release.yml`)

Triggers: Tag creation (`v*`)

```yaml
Jobs:
- build: Create distribution packages
- test: Final validation tests
- publish: Publish to PyPI (production)
- deploy: Update documentation site
- notify: Slack/Discord notifications
```

#### **Documentation** (`docs.yml`)

Triggers: Push to `main`, changes in `docs/`

```yaml
Jobs:
- build-docs: Build Sphinx documentation
- deploy-docs: Deploy to GitHub Pages
- link-check: Validate all documentation links
```

### Quality Gates

**Every commit must pass:**

1. **Code Formatting**: Black, isort
2. **Linting**: Pylint score >= 8.5
3. **Type Checking**: MyPy strict mode
4. **Security**: Bandit security analysis
5. **Tests**: pytest with 80%+ coverage
6. **Performance**: No significant regressions

### Environment Strategy

- **Development**: Local development with hot-reload
- **Testing**: Automated CI/CD environment
- **Staging**: `develop` branch auto-deployment
- **Production**: `main` branch manual deployment

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

```bash
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # Fast, isolated unit tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # Component interaction tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ automation/     # End-to-end automation tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance/    # Performance and load tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security/       # Security and penetration tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manual/         # Manual testing procedures
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for core modules
- **Integration Tests**: Critical user flows
- **Performance Tests**: No regression > 10%
- **Security Tests**: OWASP compliance
- **Manual Tests**: Real-world scenarios

### Testing Tools

```bash
# Test execution
pytest                  # Test runner
pytest-cov            # Coverage reporting
pytest-xdist          # Parallel test execution
pytest-mock           # Mocking framework

# Quality assurance
black                  # Code formatting
isort                  # Import sorting
pylint                 # Static analysis
mypy                   # Type checking
bandit                 # Security analysis
```
