### PyUnit Test Suite
- ✅ **12 tests passing (100% success rate)**
- ✅ **All core modules tested**
- ✅ **Proper mocking to avoid GUI dependencies**

## 🔧 **DIAGNOSIS**

The automation system is **working correctly**. The "zero windows found" message is likely from:

1. **No active Copilot Chat conversations** - Continue buttons only appear when:
   - GitHub Copilot Chat panel is open
   - There's an active conversation
   - Copilot is generating a response that can be continued

2. **Expected behavior** - The system correctly finds:
   - VS Code windows: ✅ 2 found
   - Screenshots: ✅ Captured successfully
   - Continue buttons: ❌ 0 found (normal when no chat active)

## 🧪 **TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS**

To test Continue button detection:

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code
2. **Start a conversation** that will have a Continue button
3. **Run the automation** while the button is visible

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test window detection
python tests/debug_window_simple.py

# Test button detection  
python tests/test_button_detection.py

# Run full automation (dry run)
python tests/test_automation_debug.py

# Run PyUnit test suite
python tests/pyunit_suite.py
```

## 📊 **STATISTICS FROM LAST TEST**

```
Window Detection: 2 VS Code windows found
- Window 1: "run.sh - computer-vision - Visual Studio Code"  
- Window 2: "final_cleanup.sh - vscode-chat-continue - Visual Studio Code"

Screenshot Capture: 1920x992 pixels captured successfully

Button Detection: 0 Continue buttons found (expected)

```

## ✅ **CONCLUSION**

The automation system is **functioning correctly**. To see Continue buttons detected, you need to:

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat panel
2. Start a conversation 
3. Wait for a response with a Continue button
4. Run the automation while the button is visible
