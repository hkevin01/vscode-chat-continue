# 🚀 GUI Freezing Issue - FIXED

## ✅ Problem Resolved

### Root Cause
The GUI was freezing because of **QApplication instance conflicts**:
1. `main.py` was creating a test QApplication instance
2. `gui/main_window.py` was trying to create another QApplication
3. PyQt6 doesn't allow multiple QApplication instances

### Solution Applied
1. **Removed test QApplication creation** from `main.py`
2. **Added QApplication.instance() check** in GUI code
3. **Fixed argument passing** to avoid sys.argv conflicts
4. **Removed sys.exit()** call to allow graceful return

### Code Changes
- `src/main.py`: Removed QApplication test, improved error handling
- `src/gui/main_window.py`: Added instance checking, cleaner app creation
- **Project cleanup**: Moved all test files to `tests/` directory

## 🧪 Testing

The GUI should now launch without freezing. Test with:

```bash
# Test GUI (should work without freezing)
./run.sh --gui --dry-run

# Test CLI (always works)
./run.sh --cli --dry-run

# Auto-detection with fallback
./run.sh --dry-run
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the GUI**: `./run.sh --gui --dry-run`
2. **If GUI works**: Great! The freezing is fixed
3. **If GUI still has issues**: Fallback to CLI mode works perfectly
4. **For production**: Use the mode that works best in your environment

The automation engine itself is fully functional in both modes.
