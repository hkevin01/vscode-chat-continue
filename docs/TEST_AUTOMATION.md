# VS Code Continue Button Test Document

This document is designed to test the VS Code automation system's ability to detect and click Continue buttons in unfocused windows.

## Test Instructions

1. **Keep this file open in VS Code**
2. **Run the automation**: `python scripts/continuous_automation.py`
3. **Focus another application** (make VS Code unfocused)
4. **Watch the automation** automatically:
   - Detect this VS Code window in the background
   - Bring it into focus
   - Look for Continue buttons (though none exist in this markdown)

## For Real Testing

To properly test the unfocused window automation:

1. **Open VS Code Copilot Chat**
2. **Start a conversation** that will show Continue buttons
3. **Run automation**: `python scripts/continuous_automation.py`
4. **Focus another app** (browser, terminal, etc.)
5. **Watch automation work** in the background

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Window Detection**: Automation finds unfocused VS Code windows
✅ **Auto Focus**: Brings VS Code window into focus when Continue button detected
✅ **Smart Clicking**: Clicks Continue buttons, not search fields or other elements
✅ **Background Operation**: Works while you use other applications

## Test Results

The automation should:
- Detect this window even when unfocused
- Attempt to bring it into focus
- Search for Continue buttons (none in this markdown file)
- Continue monitoring other VS Code windows

## Continue Testing

For actual Continue button testing, you need:
- VS Code Copilot Chat with actual Continue buttons
- Real conversation that generates Continue prompts
- The automation running in background

**Note**: This markdown file won't have actual Continue buttons to click, but it will test the window detection and focus management parts of the automation system.

Continue Continue Continue Continue Continue
(These are just text, not actual buttons)

The automation should ignore text mentions of "Continue" and only click actual UI buttons with the proper styling and position.
